# Jenkins Pipeline Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Our analysis has identified a total of 2 vulnerabilities in the Jenkinsfile, with the highest severity level being "High". The findings indicate areas of improvement to enhance the security posture of the pipeline, including the removal of unused environment variables and the specification of more restrictive agent directives. The presence of a "High" severity vulnerability underscores the need for prompt remediation to mitigate potential security risks. Overall, addressing these vulnerabilities will help strengthen the security of the pipeline and reduce the risk of potential exploits.

## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `Pipeline-Wide`

### Analysis Findings
* Vulnerability: Unused Environment Variable

    Finding: The environment variable `DEPLOY_ENV` is defined but not used in any stage.
    
    Location: The `environment` block at the top level of the pipeline.
    
    Remediation: Remove the `DEPLOY_ENV` variable from the `environment` block or use it in one of the stages.
    
    Severity: LOW
* Vulnerability: Redundant Stage Agent

    Finding: No redundant stage agent was found because no stage has an agent definition, and the global agent is defined as "any", which does not make any stage-level agent redundant by default.

However, since the question asks to follow a specific format to the letter and the primary focus is on identifying unused environment variables and redundant stage agents based on the provided rules, the response should highlight the unused environment variable as the key finding.

Given the specific instructions and the format requested for the final answer, the correct approach is to identify and report the unused environment variable as per the rules provided, without adding extra information not directly related to the findings.

Thus, focusing strictly on the format and the specific findings related to the rules provided:
* Vulnerability: Unused Environment Variable

    Finding: The environment variable `DEPLOY_ENV` is defined but not used in any stage.
    
    Location: The `environment` block at the top level of the pipeline.
    
    Remediation: Remove the `DEPLOY_ENV` variable from the `environment` block or use it in one of the stages.
    
    Severity: LOW

### Analysis for Section: `agent`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Agent 'any'
- **Finding:** The provided code snippet uses the "any" agent directive, which is a security risk as it allows the pipeline to run on any available agent, potentially including malicious ones.
- **Violating Code:** {"type": "any"}
- **Severity:** 8.7 (High)
- **Remediation:** Always specify the most restrictive agent possible, such as a specific label or a Docker image. Example: `agent { label 'linux-build-nodes' }`
