## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `agent`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Agent `any`
- **Finding:** The agent type is set to "any", which allows the job to run on any available agent, potentially leading to security issues.
- **Violating Code:** `{"type": "any"}`
- **Remediation:** Specify a specific agent label or use a more restrictive agent type to limit the job's execution environment.
- **Severity:** High

### Analysis for Section: `environment`

After analyzing the provided `CODE_SNIPPET` against the `RULEBOOK`, I did not find any violations.

"No security vulnerabilities were identified in this section."

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Build`

#### Vulnerability: Command Injection via Parameters
- **Finding:** The code directly includes a string literal that can be a password or API key, which is a high-risk pattern as the value is not sanitized.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'echo \"API_TOKEN=tok_12345...\"'`
- **Remediation:** Use the `credentials()` helper or `withCredentials` to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.
- **Severity:** Critical

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Deploy`

#### Vulnerability: Privileged Docker
- **Finding:** The Docker command uses the `--privileged` flag, which grants the container elevated privileges and increases the attack surface.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'docker run --privileged nginx:1.20.0'`
- **Remediation:** Remove the `--privileged` flag or restrict its use to only necessary containers.
- **Severity:** Critical
