# Jenkins Pipeline Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
The automated scan identified **five** distinct vulnerabilities in the Jenkinsfile, with the most severe classified as **Critical**. The findings highlight high‑risk issues such as hard‑coded credentials, privileged Docker execution, and the use of a vulnerable Docker image, indicating a need for immediate remediation to harden the pipeline’s security posture.

---

## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `agent`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Agent 'any'
- **Finding:** The pipeline specifies a generic `any` agent, allowing the pipeline to run on any available agent and exposing the build to potential malicious agents.
- **Violating Code:** `{"type": "any"}`
- **Remediation:** Always specify the most restrictive agent possible, such as a specific label or a Docker image. Example: `agent { label 'linux-build-nodes' }`
- **Severity:** 8.7 (High)

---

### Analysis for Section: `environment`

#### Vulnerability: Use of Hard‑Coded Credentials  
- **Finding:** The environment block hard‑codes the `NEXUS_USER` value (and directly references a password parameter) instead of injecting credentials via the Jenkins Credentials Plugin.  
- **Violating Code:** `{"NEXUS_USER": "admin", "NEXUS_PASS": "${params.NEXUS_PASSWORD_PARAM}"}`  
- **Remediation:** Use the Jenkins Credentials Plugin. Secrets can be safely injected using the `credentials()` helper in an `environment` block or the `withCredentials` wrapper in a `steps` block.  
- **Severity:** 9.8 (Critical)

---

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Build`

#### Vulnerability: Unmasked Secrets in Logs  
- **Finding:** The pipeline step prints a hard‑coded API token, exposing the secret in the build log.  
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'echo "API_TOKEN=tok_12345..."'`  
- **Remediation:** For secrets injected with `withCredentials`, Jenkins provides automatic masking for the console output, but the command itself can still be logged. For maximum security, use `set +x` at the beginning of your shell script to prevent the command from being echoed. Example: `sh 'set +x; my_command --token=${MY_SECRET}'`.  
- **Severity:** 7.5 (High)

---

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Deploy`

#### Vulnerability: Privileged Docker Access
- **Finding:** The pipeline runs a Docker container with the `--privileged` flag, granting excessive privileges to the container.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'docker run --privileged nginx:1.20.0'`
- **Remediation:** Avoid using `--privileged` whenever possible. Instead, grant only the specific Linux capabilities the container needs using the `--cap-add` flag. Avoid mounting the Docker socket directly.
- **Severity:** 9.1 (Critical)

#### Vulnerability: Component with Known Vulnerabilities
- **Finding:** The pipeline uses the Docker image `nginx:1.20.0`, which is a known vulnerable version.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'docker run --privileged nginx:1.20.0'`
- **Remediation:** Regularly scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Snyk. Pin dependencies to the latest patched and secure version.
- **Severity:** Varies (Often High-Critical)
