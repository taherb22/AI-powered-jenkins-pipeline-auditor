#### Vulnerability: Command Injection via Parameters
- **Finding:** The code directly includes a Jenkins parameter (`${params.BRANCH_NAME}`) in a `sh` step, which is a high-risk pattern as the parameter value is not sanitized.
- **Violating Code:** `"sh 'trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 /path/to/${params.BRANCH_NAME}''"`
