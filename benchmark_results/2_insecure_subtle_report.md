#### Vulnerability: OS Command Injection
- **Finding:** The pipeline directly interpolates the userâ€‘controlled `${params.BRANCH_NAME}` into a shell command without sanitization, creating a potential OS command injection risk.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 /path/to/${params.BRANCH_NAME}'`
- **Remediation:** Never directly substitute parameters into `sh` steps. The safest method is to pass parameters as environment variables with proper quoting. Example: `withEnv(["SAFE_PARAM=${params.USER_INPUT}"]) { sh 'my_script.sh \"$SAFE_PARAM\"' }`
- **Severity:** 9.8 (Critical)
