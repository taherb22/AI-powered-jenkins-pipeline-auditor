### Analysis for Section: `stage_Build`

#### Vulnerability: Unmasked Secrets in Logs
- **Finding:** The secret `NEXUS_AUTH` is interpolated directly into a shell command, which can be echoed in the build log and expose the credential.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'mvn clean deploy -s settings.xml -Dnexus.auth=${NEXUS_AUTH}'`
- **Remediation:** For secrets injected with `withCredentials`, Jenkins provides automatic masking for the console output, but the command itself can still be logged. For maximum security, use `set +x` at the beginning of your shell script to prevent the command from being echoed. Example: `sh 'set +x; mvn clean deploy -s settings.xml -Dnexus.auth=${NEXUS_AUTH}'`
- **Severity:** 7.5 (High)
