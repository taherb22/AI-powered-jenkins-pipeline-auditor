# Jenkins Pipeline Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Our recent security analysis of the Jenkinsfile has identified a total of 2 vulnerabilities, with the highest severity level being "High" at 8.7. These findings indicate potential security risks that could be exploited, including insecure agent configuration and unencrypted service communication. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement the recommended remediations, such as specifying restrictive agents and using encrypted channels for network communication. By addressing these vulnerabilities, we can significantly improve the overall security posture of our Jenkins pipeline.

## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `agent`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Agent 'any'
- **Finding:** The code snippet uses the global `agent` directive set to `any`, allowing the pipeline to run on any available agent, which is a security risk.
- **Violating Code:** `{"type": "any"}`
- **Severity:** 8.7 (High)
- **Remediation:** Always specify the most restrictive agent possible, such as a specific label or a Docker image. Example: `agent { label 'linux-build-nodes' }`

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Deploy`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Service Communication
- **Finding:** The code snippet communicates with a service over an unencrypted channel (HTTP instead of HTTPS) without any form of authentication, posing a risk of exposing sensitive data to network sniffing attacks.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'curl -X POST http://insecure-service.local/deploy'`
- **Severity:** 5.5 (Medium)
- **Remediation:** Always use encrypted channels (HTTPS) for all network communication. Ensure that any service endpoint that performs a sensitive action is protected by a robust authentication mechanism. Secrets for authentication should be stored in and injected via the Jenkins Credentials Plugin. Example of a more secure call: `withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'deploy-token', variable: 'TOKEN')]) { sh 'curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://secure-service.local/deploy' }`
