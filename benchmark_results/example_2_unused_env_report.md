# Jenkins Pipeline Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Our recent security analysis of the Jenkinsfile identified a total of 2 vulnerabilities, with the highest severity level being "High". The findings indicate areas of improvement to enhance the overall security posture, including the removal of unused environment variables and the specification of more restrictive agents to mitigate potential security risks. The majority of the analyzed sections did not exhibit any security vulnerabilities, suggesting a generally well-structured pipeline. Overall, addressing these vulnerabilities will help strengthen the security of the pipeline and reduce potential attack surfaces.

## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `Pipeline-Wide`

**Vulnerability:** Unused Environment Variable  

**Finding:** The environment variable `BUILD_MODE` is defined but never referenced in any stage steps or conditions.  

**Location:** Topâ€‘level `environment` block.  

**Remediation:** Remove the `BUILD_MODE` definition or reference it in the pipeline (e.g., `$BUILD_MODE` or `${BUILD_MODE}`) where needed.  

**Severity:** LOW

### Analysis for Section: `agent`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Agent 'any'
- **Finding:** The code snippet uses the global `agent` directive set to `any`, allowing the pipeline to run on any available agent, which is a security risk.
- **Violating Code:** `{"type": "any"}`
- **Severity:** 8.7 (High)
- **Remediation:** Always specify the most restrictive agent possible, such as a specific label or a Docker image. Example: `agent { label 'linux-build-nodes' }`
