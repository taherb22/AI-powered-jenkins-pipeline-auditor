## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `agent`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Agent `any`
- **Finding:** The agent type is set to "any", which allows any available agent to execute the pipeline, potentially leading to security issues.
- **Violating Code:** `{"type": "any"}`
- **Remediation:** Specify a specific agent type or label to restrict the pipeline execution to a trusted environment.
- **Severity:** High

### Analysis for Section: `environment`

#### Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secrets
- **Finding:** A hardcoded API key is present in the environment section.
- **Violating Code:** `{"API_KEY": "secret-key-12345"}`
- **Remediation:** Store sensitive information like API keys securely using a credentials manager or environment variables.
- **Severity:** Critical

---

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Build`

#### Vulnerability: Command Injection via Parameters
- **Finding:** The code directly includes a string literal in a `sh` step, which is a high-risk pattern as the input is not sanitized.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'echo \"password=supersecret\"'`
- **Remediation:** Use the `credentials()` helper or `withCredentials` to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.
- **Severity:** High

---

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Deploy`

#### Vulnerability: Privileged Docker
- **Finding:** The code uses the `--privileged` flag with Docker, which can lead to security issues.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'docker run --privileged ubuntu'`
- **Remediation:** Remove the `--privileged` flag or restrict its use to only necessary cases.
- **Severity:** Critical
