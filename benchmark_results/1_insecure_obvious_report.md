# Jenkins Pipeline Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
The scan identified **four** distinct vulnerabilities within the Jenkins pipeline, with the most severe classification being **Critical**. These findings highlight significant risks, including hard‑coded credentials, privileged Docker execution, and insufficient agent and secret handling, indicating an overall high‑risk security posture that requires immediate remediation.

## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `agent`

#### Vulnerability: Insecure Agent 'any'
- **Finding:** The pipeline specifies a generic `any` agent, allowing the pipeline to run on any available agent and exposing the build to potential malicious agents.
- **Violating Code:** `{"type": "any"}`
- **Remediation:** Always specify the most restrictive agent possible, such as a specific label or a Docker image. Example: `agent { label 'linux-build-nodes' }`
- **Severity:** 8.7 (High)

---

### Analysis for Section: `environment`

#### Vulnerability: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials
- **Finding:** The pipeline defines a secret API key directly in the source code, exposing a hard‑coded credential.
- **Violating Code:** `{"API_KEY": "secret-key-12345"}`
- **Remediation:** Use the Jenkins Credentials Plugin. Secrets can be safely injected using the `credentials()` helper in an `environment` block or the `withCredentials` wrapper in a `steps` block.
- **Severity:** 9.8 (Critical)

---

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Build`

#### Vulnerability: Unmasked Secrets in Logs
- **Finding:** The pipeline step prints a hard‑coded password, exposing a secret in the build logs.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'echo "password=supersecret"'`
- **Remediation:** For secrets injected with `withCredentials`, Jenkins provides automatic masking for the console output, but the command itself can still be logged. For maximum security, use `set +x` at the beginning of your shell script to prevent the command from being echoed. Example: `sh 'set +x; my_command --password=${MY_SECRET}'`
- **Severity:** 7.5 (High)

---

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Deploy`

#### Vulnerability: Privileged Docker Access
- **Finding:** The pipeline executes a Docker container with the `--privileged` flag, granting excessive privileges to the container.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'docker run --privileged ubuntu'`
- **Remediation:** Avoid using `--privileged` whenever possible. Instead, grant only the specific Linux capabilities the container needs using the `--cap-add` flag. Avoid mounting the Docker socket directly.
- **Severity:** 9.1 (Critical)
