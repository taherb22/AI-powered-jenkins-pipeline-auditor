# Jenkins Pipeline Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
The automated scan identified **two** security vulnerabilities in the Jenkinsfile, with the most severe being classified as **Critical**. The critical issue stems from an OS command injection risk via a user‑supplied password, while a high‑severity issue exposes a secret password in build logs. Immediate remediation—using credential‑binding mechanisms and masking secret usage—will substantially improve the pipeline’s security posture.

## Detailed Specialist Findings
### Analysis for Section: `agent`

No security vulnerabilities were identified in this section.

---

### Analysis for Section: `environment`

#### Vulnerability: OS Command Injection
- **Finding:** The pipeline injects a user‑supplied parameter `${params.USER_SUPPLIED_PASSWORD}` directly into an environment variable, which can be exploited for command injection if the value is later used in a shell step without sanitization.
- **Violating Code:** `{"NEXUS_PASSWORD": "${params.USER_SUPPLIED_PASSWORD}"}`  
- **Severity:** 9.8 (Critical)  
- **Remediation:** Never use `${params.*}` directly. For secrets, ALWAYS use the `withCredentials` block. For non‑secret parameters, pass them to scripts as arguments and sanitize them within the script.

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Deploy`

#### Vulnerability: Unmasked Secrets in Logs
- **Finding:** The `sh` step prints a command that includes the resolved secret `$NEXUS_PASSWORD`, potentially exposing the secret in the build logs.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'deploy.sh --user admin --password $NEXUS_PASSWORD'`
- **Severity:** 7.5 (High)
- **Remediation:** For secrets injected with `withCredentials`, Jenkins provides automatic masking for the console output, but the command itself can still be logged. For maximum security, use `set +x` at the beginning of your shell script to prevent the command from being echoed. Example: `sh 'set +x; my_command --password=${MY_SECRET}'`
