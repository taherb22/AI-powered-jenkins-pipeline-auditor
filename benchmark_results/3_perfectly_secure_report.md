---

### Analysis for Section: `environment`

No security vulnerabilities were identified in this section.

### Analysis for Section: `stage_Build`

#### Vulnerability: Unmasked Secrets in Logs
- **Finding:** The Maven command includes the resolved `${NEXUS_PASS}` secret, which can be echoed in the build log and expose the credential.
- **Violating Code:** `sh 'mvn clean deploy -Dpassword=${NEXUS_PASS}'`
- **Remediation:** For secrets injected with `withCredentials`, Jenkins provides automatic masking for the console output, but the command itself can still be logged. For maximum security, use `set +x` at the beginning of your shell script to prevent the command from being echoed. Example: `sh 'set +x; my_command --password=${MY_SECRET}'`.
- **Severity:** 7.5 (High)
